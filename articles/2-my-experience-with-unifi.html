                A few months ago I purchased a UniFi Dream Router after experiencing problems with my ISP-provided router. And now I can't go back. I have tried 2 different ISP routers as well as a couple "gaming" routers. The difference between your router and the UniFi Dream Router is that UniFi makes enterprise hardware. They managed to pack all of the enterprise features from their super expensive rackmount hardware into a small $200 device. You might be wondering what the difference is between a residential and enterprise router. The main thing is reliability. With the dream router, I have had zero down time not related to power outages.
