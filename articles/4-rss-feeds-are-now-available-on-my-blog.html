            I have created an RSS feed for my blog! This means you can now view my posts in your preferred RSS reader.
            <br><br>
            As of right now, I am still manually creating articles with HTML and manually adding them to the RSS feed. I am looking into solutions for this to make the process more streamlined. Stay tuned for more!
