                I have just released the first version of my voice assistant Excalibur! It is an alternative to voice assistants like Google and Alexa but privacy focused. You can download it <a href="https://github.com/sidgames5/excalibur/releases">on github</a>.
                <br><br>
                The voice assistant is written completely in python. It uses Vosk for speech recognition and Ollama for AI processing. It currently has the ability to answer questions, give you the time, and give you the weather. It works by detecting words in your prompt like "weather" and "time" and gives you a result based on that. If none of the trigger words are detected, it hands off the prompt to the AI which will try its best to generate an answer.
                <br><br>
                I am working on adding smart device control and integration with other services like Spotify and Nextcloud. Hopefully this project will become good enough to take on popular privacy-invading voice assistants.
